# Dtmf-Controlled-Car
Arduino Code for making a dtmf controlled car

Using this one can create a Dtmf controlled Car.
The main components required for this are 
1) Arduino Uno
2) DTMF Decoder
3) Motor Driver L293D
4) A mobile with network
and other basic components such as a power source i.e a 9V battery, jumper cables etc.

For the connections, refer to the code.

A dtmf controlled car is basically a car that has a dtmf decoder attached to it along with a gsm module/mobile phone.
The briefing of the working it that whenever the person calls the mobile attached to the dtmf decoder and inputs digits from the dialer, the car is being able to get controlled.
Its a really interesting project. Try it out!!
